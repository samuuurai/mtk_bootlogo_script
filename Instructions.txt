Before starting make sure you have python3 and zip installed.
Script only works for MT67xx processors.

Generating stock logo.bin for Begonia:
No special instructions, just execute the script by typing ./generate in terminal and choose logo signing (Important else the phone will get bricked)

Generating customized logo.bin for Begonia:
I have already mentioned that even if you change a single image, you get a brick, though you are free to experiment with the script and your device,
reach out to me if you successfully create a custom one.

Generating customized logo.bin for another device:
1. Follow the same procedure as stock one
2. Replace the images with whatever you like (Most devices use the *_kernel.bmp as fastboot and *_uboot.bmp as boot splash) 
3. Run the script
4. Profit or brick

I understand this script is useless and a total kang, but this is my first repo on github, I put this on there to look back at my retardedness someday.
